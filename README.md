4. **Unified Platform:** Offers a single, standardised communication tool that can be utilised among various hospital¬†departments.
5. **Always Connected:** Using SMS notifications to notify users of vital messages when offline.
6. **User Friendly Design:** Featuring a straightforward UI that is simple to understand and apply, even in high-pressure situations.
