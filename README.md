## Overviewüî®
Think of a chat applications created mainly for hospitals and healthcare professionals that is just as reliable as a pager but has the features of a modern chat platform. That's MedicalPager!!. It allows doctors and medical personnel to remain connected and up to date with their hospital divisions, which results in seamless communication and better patient care.

## Problem and Solution

## The ProblemüÜò

In the fast-moving, high-stakes world of hospitals, efficient communication is essential. However, traditional means of communication have certain limitations:

1. **Traditional Pagers:** While reliable and capable of penetrating thick hospital walls, they have limited functionality and only allow for one-way communication.
2. **Cell Phones:** Cell phones are frequently unreliable in hospital settings due to poor reception and network congestion during emergency situations.
3. **Multiple Systems:** Using several communication technologies results in disorganised data and possibly miscommunication.

Healthcare personnel want a platform that combines the dependability of pagers with the capability of current communication apps, all while responding to the specific needs of the medical field.

## Our Solution

The Medical Pager Chat App responds to these issues by:

1. **Reliable Infrastructure:** Using robust messaging systems to ensure communication even in locations with low cell coverage.
2. **Advanced Functionality:** Provides two-way communication with features such as direct and group conversations, multimedia sharing, and threaded replies.
3. **Emergency-Ready:** Prioritise sending messages in critically important situations to verified personnels, same as traditional pager systems does.
4. **Unified Platform:** Offers a single, standardised communication tool that can be utilised among various hospital¬†departments.
5. **Always Connected:** Using SMS notifications to notify verified users of vital messages when offline.
6. **User Friendly Design:** Featuring a straightforward UI that is simple to understand and apply, even in high-pressure situations.

Our Medical Pager Chat App combines the¬†features of traditional pagers and current chat applications to deliver a complete, dependable, and effective communication solution for healthcare professionals, eventually improving patient care and the operation of hospitals.

   ## Security and User Management

We've implemented strict rules for managing members/users across all types of chats in Medical Pager to ensure security and proper access control:

* **Automatic Memberships:**
   * Users cannot leave or be removed from chats they were automatically added to. For example:
     - Doctors cannot leave or be removed from their hospital's general chat
     - Department heads cannot leave or be removed from their department's chat

* **Private Conversations:**
   * Members cannot leave or be removed from their private conversations (DMs)

* **Administrative Control:**
   * Hospital administrators have the highest level of control and can manage most user access, with some exceptions

* **Department-Specific:**
   * Department members cannot leave or be removed from their department's dedicated chat

* **Patient-Related Chats:**
   * The primary physician cannot leave or be removed from their patient's case discussion
   * Assigned nurses cannot leave or be removed from their patients' care coordination chats

* **Administrative Powers:**
   * Hospital administrators can remove any regular user from any chat, except where noted above

These rules are designed to maintain the integrity of communication channels, ensure that critical information reaches the right people and prevent accidental or unauthorized removal of essential personnel from important conversations.
